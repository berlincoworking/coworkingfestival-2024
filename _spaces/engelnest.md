description: "Engelnest is a community-oriented coworking space and event venue in the heart of Berlin’s Schöneberg district, transformed from a former pallet store through upcycling pallets and other construction materials. We provide a welcoming environment for entrepreneurs, freelancers, and creatives who value collaboration and innovation.

Engelnest aims to be a fair space for all, with a strong commitment to social responsibility. Our support extends to both local and international communities, and we proudly sponsor numerous NGOs. Additionally, we offer a gender pay gap discount for female expats, freelancers, and entrepreneurs, championing equality and diversity in the workplace.

Here, you’ll find a strong community in modern amenities. Our unique meeting containers, and authentic event venues make Engelnest a distinctive place to work and gather."

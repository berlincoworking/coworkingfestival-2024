Our community consists of more than 300 international members from over 50 industries. Whether experienced professionals, new starters, or travelers – we offer individual and flexible solutions for every need. Whether it's offices, desks, business addresses, meeting or event rooms, we provide the latest state-of-the-art equipment along with all-around service. As a team, we want to offer our members and guests the best possible service, which is confirmed by the multitude of positive feedback. We are always on-site and can therefore respond quickly to our members' requests. Besides that, Space Shack stands out due to its exceptional architecture and creative interior design. A place where everyone comes together and feels comfortable. Let's shape the future of work and life.

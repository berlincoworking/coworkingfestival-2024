      <h2>What is coworking?</h2>
      <p>
        Coworking is about collaborating with the people around you, whether or not they’re in the same field or
        company. The aim is to provide a professional and social network without depending on a specific employer or
        company, and gaining more tools for flexibility and creative output. In short—it’s the new way to work.

      <h2>Can you elaborate more on the idea and aim of the festival?</h2>
      <p>The Coworking Festival is a co-created one week long event that aims to raise the profile of coworking spaces
        in Germany, attracting new
        members and fostering collaboration among them. It promotes the benefits of coworking, such as professional
        environments,
        community, and work place autonomy. The festival's theme, "Work Renaissance: Shaping the Future
        Together," emphasizes the current transformation of work and the power of coworking to shape it. By promoting
        local
        events and spaces,
        the festival seeks to inspire, connect, and support coworking operators and their communities. Ultimately, it
        aims to strengthen the coworking sector by raising its public visibility.

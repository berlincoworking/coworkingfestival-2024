description: "The cocreation.loft is a space for personal development, a room for exploring innovative ways of working and an incubator for system changers working to make a difference in society.<br/>
In a world that’s increasingly disconnected, the cocreation.loft is a place to not only work, but grow, be inspired, and belong.<br/>
The loft isn’t just somewhere you come to work and then go home. Each and every member is encouraged to bring their full selves into the space, to connect, collaborate and co-create."

description: "workish.berlin is a space for work and other stuff. 

[work-] We took over the space from betahaus in 2021, inheriting super nice furniture and all the equipment you need for serious work. We’ve since grown to 3 floors of coworking, private offices, event space, and 100+ members, right here in Neukölln.

[-ish] This is where the creative, fun, collaborative, scrappy, weird, entrepreneurial stuff comes in. After work beers every Wednesday. Exhibitions. Parties. A yoga room. We’ve even got a FabLab in the basement that we share with our neighbors at 42 Berlin. And since -ish is hard to describe, that’s the stuff you’ll have to see for yourself."
